## Welcome to 2KS Technologies Inc.

# Open Source Technologies geared to helping us with well rounded personal and professional lives

Welcome to 2KS Tech.  We are interested in open source technologies that provide building blocks for community services that enrich our personal and professional lives.

## 🚀 Who is 2KS Tech?

2KS Tech is developing a suite of secure, open-source tools designed to support the creation and growth of community platforms. We focus on building secure, modular foundations that empower communities to learn, communicate, and connect in healthy, forward-thinking ways.

We are in the early stages of development, with initial platforms including:

**Secure IODC Single Sign-On (SSO)** A secure authentication service that connects trusted identity applications with feature-rich tools such as email and calendaring.

**Upskill Studio** Built in collaboration with the open-source project https://github.com/Ebazhanov/linkedin-skill-assessments-quizzes, Upskill Studio is a testing and assessment platform designed to support interviewing, skills evaluation, and professional development. It also helps users strengthen their knowledge of LinkedIn features, best practices, and professional networking strategies.
